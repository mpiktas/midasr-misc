With additional conditions, the least squares estimator is asymptotically normal. A new, specification-robust estimator of the covariance matrix is obtained, which simplifies to the usual estimator when the model is correct up to an independent additive error. The properties of the approximation and the covariance estimator are exploited to yield new tests for model misspecification. These results are applied to two examples in economics.},

  abstract={Mixed-data sampling (MIDAS) regressions allow to estimate dynamic equations that explain a low-frequency variable by high-frequency variables and their lags. When the difference in sampling frequencies between the regressand and the regressors is large, distributed lag functions are typically employed to model dynamics avoiding parameter proliferation. In macroeconomic applications, however, differences in sampling frequencies are often small. In such a case, it might not be necessary to employ distributed lag functions. In this paper, we discuss the pros and cons of unrestricted lag polynomials in MIDAS regressions. We derive unrestricted MIDAS regressions (U-MIDAS) from linear high-frequency models, discuss identification issues, and show that their parameters can be estimated by OLS. In Monte Carlo experiments, we compare U-MIDAS to MIDAS with functional distributed lags estimated by NLS. We show that U-MIDAS generally performs better than MIDAS when mixing quarterly and monthly data. On the other hand, with larger differences in sampling frequencies, distributed lag-functions outperform unrestricted polynomials. In an empirical application on out-of-sample nowcasting GDP in the US and the Euro area using monthly predictors, we find a good performance of U-MIDAS for a number of indicators, albeit the results depend on the evaluation sample. We suggest to consider U-MIDAS as a potential alternative to the existing MIDAS approach in particular for mixing monthly and quarterly variables. In practice, the choice between the two approaches should be made on a case-by-case basis, depending on their relative performance. --},

The models are developed within the framework of dynamic linear models, which provides a high level of flexibility and allows direct interpretation of the results. The problem of the collinearity of intraperiod observations is solved using model selection and model averaging approaches. Bayesian approaches to model selection automatically adjust for multiple comparisons, while predictions based on model averaging allow us to account for both model and parameter uncertainty when predicting future observations. A novel aspect of the models presented here is the introduction of new formulations for the prior distribution on the model space that allow us to favor sparse models where the significant coefficients cluster on adjacent lags of the high frequency predictor. We illustrate our approach by predicting the gross national product of the United States using the term structure of interest rates.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Assuming the order k is asymptotically sufficient to overcome bias, the autoregression yields a consistent estimator of the spectral density of {xt}. Furthermore, assuming k goes to infinity so that the bias from using a finite autoregression vanishes at a sufficient rate, the autoregressive spectral estimates are asymptotically normal, uncorrelated at different fixed frequencies. The asymptotic variance is the same as for spectral estimates based on a truncated periodogram.},
